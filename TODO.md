        - Plan on reading it 4-5 times. The first time it is going to be a whole bunch of new words/concepts -- "a different language" as you put it.
        - Only read the introduction.
        1. The first reading is to inventory the words, where they are used, and how important they are. Don't try to understand except in the most vague of ways.
        2. The second time you can start to make some sense out of it because hopefully you think you might understand 1/3- 1/2 of the words.
        - Now look up some definitions. Google might help, otherwise the difficult word(s) might be cited, in which case you need to read the abstract of the relevant paper (only enough to get a definition of what the word might mean).
        3. The third time you read it, you should know 1/2 to 2/3rds of the words and be able to make good connections between them, you start to see the ideas take shape.
        4. The fourth read you fill in the gaps from the outline you made in the third read.
