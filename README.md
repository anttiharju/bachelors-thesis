# Software project success factors and limitations of their universality

The thesis is written in Finnish, but the English abstract has been copy-pasted below:

This thesis focuses on the success factors of software projects and limitations of their universality. The success factor research is viewed as valuable, as a lot of resources are wasted on unsuccessful projects. Therefore, even small improvements to the success percentage have measurable value. The research goals were to collect universality limitations of success factors and provide starting points for further research. The research roughly follows the systematic mapping study method. The literature was mainly collected from journals associated with information systems science. Additionally, more general viewpoints were included by collecting articles from project management journals. As the results of this research, common success factor research starting points were identified. Furthermore, important non-scientific literature related to success factor research was also identified. A list of success factors is also presented, to present examples of what success factors are. Finally, thoughts expressed in the reviewed literature about the universality limitations of success factors are presented. It can be concluded that the research on software project success factors is still evolving. For example, success factor as a term isn’t strictly defined, leading to variation in usage. Regardless of the evolving field and the detected variation, the reviewed literature wasn’t contradictory. For example, the critique presented in older articles towards the definition of project success was explainable with the seemingly newer way of dividing project success to project management and project success.
